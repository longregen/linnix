# Linnix FAQ

## What kernel versions are supported?
- **Recommended**: Linux 5.8+ with BTF packages installed (Ubuntu 20.04+, Fedora 33+, modern Debian).
- **Minimum**: Linux 4.4 with `CONFIG_BPF_SYSCALL` enabled. Older kernels run in a “core-only” mode that captures fork/exec/exit but skips advanced RSS and page-fault metrics.
- **BTF tips**: Ship `/sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux` (or package-specific paths) so Linnix can compute struct offsets dynamically. Without BTF, the daemon logs a warning and continues with degraded telemetry.

## How much overhead should I expect?
- The end-to-end pipeline (eBPF + cognitod) stays under **1% CPU and 10–20 MB RAM** on typical hosts.
- Reasons it is lightweight:
  1. Tracepoints fire only when the kernel already handles fork/exec/exit events (event-driven, no polling).
  2. Per-CPU buffers and lock-free maps avoid contention.
  3. Binary payloads (~200 bytes) minimize copies between kernel and userspace.
- If you see sustained >1% CPU, check for debug builds, noisy workloads during benchmarking, or missing BTF (which forces slower fallback paths). Run `sudo ./test_ebpf_overhead.sh` to capture a reproducible report.

## How does Linnix handle data privacy?
- **On-host processing**: All capture, reasoning, and dashboards run on your infrastructure. There is no mandatory SaaS ingestion or remote control plane.
- **BYO LLM**: Point the reasoner to any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Use your own llama.cpp deployment, enterprise LLM gateway, or even air-gapped models.
- **Network controls**: Block outbound traffic entirely if needed. Linnix does not require the internet once binaries/models are installed.
- **Data minimization**: eBPF payloads include PIDs, command lines, and lightweight resource counters—no application payloads or user data are copied from memory.

## Do I still need Prometheus, Datadog, or Elastic?
Yes. Linnix focuses on process-level truth and AI explanations. Continue using Prometheus/Grafana for historical metrics, or Datadog/Elastic for traces and logs. Linnix exposes its own `/metrics/prometheus`, so you can scrape its counters into the rest of your observability stack.

## Can I disable the AI reasoner?
Absolutely. Set the reasoner endpoint to empty in `linnix.toml` or stop the LLM container. The daemon will keep emitting rule hits and raw events over JSON/SSE; you simply lose the natural-language summaries.

## What permissions are required?
- Run cognitod with `CAP_BPF`, `CAP_PERFMON`, and `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`, or just start it as root.
- Ensure `/sys/fs/bpf` is writable so programs and maps can be pinned.
- Some optional probes (network/file IO) may require kernel configs such as `CONFIG_KPROBE_EVENTS`.

Still stuck? Open a GitHub Discussion or file an issue with your kernel version, cognitod logs, and what you observed. The team actively triages “Good First Issues” for new contributors.
